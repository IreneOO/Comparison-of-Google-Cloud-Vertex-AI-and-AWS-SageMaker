          "This class covers topics on computer simulation and performance evaluation in computer systems. The course introduces basic computational and mathematical techniques for modeling, simulating and analyzing the performance by using simulation, including models, random number generation, statistics analysis, and discrete event-driven simulation. The course also covers both classic and timely techniques in the area of performance evaluation, including workload characterization, capacity planning, and resource management in enterprise systems, computer networks, data center, and cloud computing."
